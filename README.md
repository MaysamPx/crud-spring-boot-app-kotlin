# Kotlin CRUD App
While this is a pretty simple repo to try some basic practices with a focus on `Kotlin`, `Spring Boot`, `JUnit`, `Mockito`, etc., I aim to build up a **grocery app** with some useful features.

## Tools and Technologies
- Kotlin (V2+)
- JDK 21 (Amazon Corretto | OpenJDK)
- Spring Boot (V 3+)
- Gradle
- JUnit V5
- Mockito
- PostgreSQL (V16+)
- Flyway (DB migrations)


## How to run 
1. Check out the repo on your client 
2. Ensure Kotlin, JDK 21, Intellij idea (or your preferred IDE) are installed and ready to use. 
3. Run the app `KotlinCrudAppApplication`
